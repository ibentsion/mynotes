## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Region-first segmentation (not line-only): Hebrew notes have diagonal/overlapping text
- CRNN+CTC over TrOCR: lighter, trains CPU with <300 samples
- CPU-only for MVP: no local CUDA; dataset small enough
- uv_build backend with src/mynotes/ layout (required for uv package builds)
- .python-version committed (not gitignored) for tool pinning

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
